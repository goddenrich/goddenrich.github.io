## Graduate student: Masters in computer science Columbia

I am pursuing my masters in comupters science at Columbia following the machine learning track. I graduated from Cambridge University in 2009 studying mathematics. I have worked in a wide variety of industries from manufacturing, electronics, energy supply. I am interested in computational neuro science and machine learning especially looking at the links between the two fields to investigate how we learn from data presented to us by our sensory organs and how we can use this to improve machine learning algorithms.

## Projects I have done:

 * Written a weighted round robin scheduling class with idle cpu balancing in the linux kernel
 * Written a basic web server from scratch in C which serves html to a browser and allows lookups to a backend database.
 * [Fake news challenge](https://goddenrich.github.io/aml-fnc/): trained various classifiers including LSTMs, SVD, SVM and Ensemble models to determining the stance between an excerpt from a news article and a headline.
 * [Music styles](https://goddenrich.github.io/music-styles/): learning embeddings for chords based on word2vec skipgram techniques and using them to classify musical styles from midi files.
 * [Neural style transfer](https://yogeshg.github.io/artistic-styles/): Implemented and trained VGG-19 in theano and used it to implement the technique proposed by [Gatys et al](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780634/)
