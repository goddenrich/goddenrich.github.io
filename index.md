## Education:

Columbia University: Masters of Science in Computer Science

I recently graduated from my masters in computers science at Columbia. I was particularly interested in machine learning including deep learning but also gained a passion for operating systems. I studied computational neuroscience to get a better understanding of the algorithms in the brain.

University of Cambridge: MA, Mathematics

I graduated from Cambridge University in 2009 having studied Mathematics with a particular focus on statistics. Between then and my masters I worked for seven years in a wide variety of technical and business roles in industries from manufacturing, electronics to energy supply.

## Other things

I dance salsa, bachata, kizomba and brazilian zouk. I am an artist particularly figure drawing and painting and very occasionally dust off my saxophone and clarinet.
