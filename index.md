## Experience:
 Throught Machine: Tech Lead Manager, Developer Experience

Responsible for the systems which get code from a developers machine to delivered ready for installation. We have an engineering department of over 300 developers contributing to a monorepo practicing continuous integration. We develop mainly in golang and deploy our microservice systems in kubernetes. Some of the main systems my team mage are:
* Woodhouse: an in house distributed scalable CI/CD system written in golang deployed with kubernetes which paralelises the tasks of building and testing our repo and vault our microservice product.
* [Mettle](https://github.com/thought-machine/please-servers): an in house distributed build system which remotely runs builds and tests on hundreds of workers. Running 3 million tests a day as part of our CI process.
* [Phabricator](https://github.com/phacility/phabricator): The application we use for code reviews. We recently migrated our clustered self hosted instance to kubernetes automating the management of the component nodes with a tool we call Phacsimile.
* Cromwell: An in house system for automating the process of promoting versions of our product [Vault](https://thoughtmachine.net/vault) through our environments to production.
* Aftermath: An in house test reporting system which processes and analyses the 3 million tests we run daily providing reports and automating tasks like highlighting flaky tests.

 Glemore Gas: Technical Manager
* Petra: Identified opportunities for oil field development using production and geological data, Developed modules within geological analysis systems to streamline work flows.
* Sharepoint online: Implemented sharepoint platform for business

Ebico Oxford: Commercial Projects Manager
* Energy-supply business: Project manager for the development plan to set up a new, branded business model.
* Commercial: Developed key business-to-business relationships with external partnerships and suppliers and negotiated contracts and services.
* Cloud services transition: Project managed the companies transition to a cloud computing system

E2V Technologies Plc: Continuous Improvement Champion and Analyst
* Manufacturing Capacity: developed SAP software to analyse and reduce capacity constraint on S&OP process.
* Magnetron business: Developed forecasting tools to predict requirements of a key customer and assisted in the development of a more protable contract.
* Global sales: Ran the weekly global sales forecasting system and presented it to the Executive Committee, analysing changes to the forecasts and highlighting key opportunities.

Havelock Europa Plc: Associate, Operations
* Time log: Automated the time log booking on contracts within CIMPAC system eliminating manual task
* On-time Delivery & QA: Managed a team of 14 to analyse failures, implementing preventative process.

## Education:

Columbia University: Masters of Science in Computer Science

I graduated from my masters in computers science at Columbia. I was particularly interested in machine learning including deep learning but also gained a passion for systems development which guided my choice to become a software engineer rather than data scientist. I studied computational neuroscience to get a better understanding of the algorithms in the brain.

University of Cambridge: MA, Mathematics

I graduated from Cambridge University in 2009 having studied Mathematics with a particular focus on statistics. Between then and my masters I worked for seven years in a wide variety of technical and business roles in industries from manufacturing, electronics to energy supply.

## Other things

I dance salsa, bachata, kizomba and brazilian zouk. I have recently started climbing or more acurately falling from about 4m. I am an artist particularly figure drawing and painting and very occasionally dust off my saxophone and clarinet.
